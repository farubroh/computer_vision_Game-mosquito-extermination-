<h1>Computer Vision Game:</h1>

<h1>Overview:</h1>
This project is a computer vision-based game developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The goal of the game is to swat mosquitoes and avoid bees using real-time hand tracking as the primary control mechanism.

<h1>Features:</h1>
<p>Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition: Uses MediaPipe to track 21 hand landmarks, allowing the player to use their hand as a joystick.
Real-time Interaction: Integrates OpenCV for capturing and processing real-time video input from the webcam.
Game Logic: Developed using Pygame, with elements such as flying mosquitoes and bees, scoring system, and collision detection.</p>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Python </li>
  <li>OpenCV</li>
  <li>MediaPipe </li>
  <li>Pygame </li>
</ul>

<h1>How It Works:</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Hand Tracking: MediaPipe tracks the position of the hand in real-time using 21 landmarks. </li>
  <li>Image Processing: OpenCV captures frames from the webcam and processes them for hand detection. </li>
  <li>Game Mechanics: Pygame handles the game logic, including the movement of mosquitoes and bees, collision detection, and scoring. </li>
</ol>
