Computer Vision Game:

Overview
This project is a computer vision-based game developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The goal of the game is to swat mosquitoes and avoid bees using real-time hand tracking as the primary control mechanism.

Features
Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition: Uses MediaPipe to track 21 hand landmarks, allowing the player to use their hand as a joystick.
Real-time Interaction: Integrates OpenCV for capturing and processing real-time video input from the webcam.
Game Logic: Developed using Pygame, with elements such as flying mosquitoes and bees, scoring system, and collision detection.
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
Pygame
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/computer-vision-game.git
cd computer-vision-game
Set up a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the game:

sh
Copy code
python main.py
Use your webcam to control the game by moving your hand. Swat mosquitoes to gain points and avoid bees to prevent losing points.

How It Works
Hand Tracking: MediaPipe tracks the position of the hand in real-time using 21 landmarks.
Image Processing: OpenCV captures frames from the webcam and processes them for hand detection.
Game Mechanics: Pygame handles the game logic, including the movement of mosquitoes and bees, collision detection, and scoring.
